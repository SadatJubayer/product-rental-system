## üóÑÔ∏è Project Structure

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and the project structure looks like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images,icons,fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application.
|
+-- constants         # Constants of the applications are here.
|
+-- contexts          # shared contexts used across the entire application.
|
+-- data              # Static datasets.
|
+-- features          # feature based modules, a feature can have components, hooks, assets etc.
|
+-- hooks            # shared hooks used across the entire application.
|
+-- pages            # All pages of the application are here.
|
+-- types            # shared types used across the entire application.
|
+-- utils            # shared utility functions.
|
+ eslintrc.json        # Adds the ESLint configuration for the project.
|
+ prettierrc.js        # Adds the Prettier configuration for the project.
|
+ tailwind.config.js   # TailwindCSS configuration file. Added some global theming here.
```

## üíª Technical Choices

-   `React` was the requirement.
-   `TypeScript` made the application fully typed.
-   `React Context API` - As this application is comparatively tiny, I have chosen ContextAPI over a global state library like Redux or Recoil.
-   `TailwindCSS` - Tailwind is a utility-based, highly-customizable framework .Used it for styling the whole application without writing a single line of custom CSS. It also provided a customizable theme.
-   `classnames` - It helps to make conditional styling. All it is is a single function, taking different values as arguments and spitting out a single string based on them.

## üí° Logic

Besides the logic from the provided document, I have added some extra logic to make the application more logical. Here is the the list of all logics -

-   User can book a product only if the product's _Minimum Rental Period_ is smaller than the user's given period.

-   If a user books more than the _Minimum Rental Period_, a 10% discount will be applied. The discount amount is changeable from the constant file.

-   When a user books a product, It will be unavailable for booking.

-   When a user returns a product, It will be available for booking again. But if its durability is greater than 0.

-   When a user returns a product, mileage and durability will be changed based on the user's input.

-   While booking, users can't select a date before today.

## üëå Improvements

As the time was limited to develop the project, I couldn't make it with all the ideas in my mind. Things I consider adding to make it better -

**More Testing**: I have added some test cases with the `React Testing Library` for some components. Writing more test cases would be great.

**Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks can be added to check esLint errors, prettier errors, tests, and build errors. `lint-staged` & `husky` would be a good combination for this.
